The application of deep learning approaches in context to improve health diagnosis is providing impactful solutions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), proper brain tumor diagnosis involves detection, brain tumor location identification, and classification of the tumor on the basis of malignancy, grade, and type.

# About Dataset
from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset
This dataset is a combination of the following three datasets :
figshare
SARTAJ dataset
Br35H

This dataset contains 7023 images of human brain MRI images which are classified into 4 classes: glioma - meningioma - no tumor and pituitary.

no tumor class images were taken from the Br35H dataset.

I think SARTAJ dataset has a problem that the glioma class images are not categorized correctly, I realized this from the results of other people's work as well as the different models I trained, which is why I deleted the images in this folder and used the images on the figshare site instead.
